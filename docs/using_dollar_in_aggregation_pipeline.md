# Understanding the use of `$` in a MongoDB clause


Question:

in the following aggregation why do we use 'stage' in the $match and "$stage" in the $group clause.
Why is one stage with $ and one without $

```js
db.trees.aggregate(
  {
    $match : { stage: {$exists: true} }
  },
  {
    $group : {
      _id: "$stage",
      count: {$sum : 1}
    }
  }
)
```

## The Aggregation Pipeline Breakdown


### 1. `$match` Stage: Using `stage` Without `$`

```javascript
$match: { stage: { $exists: true } }
```

- **Purpose:** The `$match` stage filters documents based on specified criteria.
- **Usage of `stage`:** Here, `stage` is used as a **field name**. You're instructing MongoDB to find all documents where the `stage` field exists.
- **No `$` Prefix:** In the context of `$match`, you're **specifying criteria based on field names and their values**. The keys in the `$match` stage represent **field names** in the documents, and their corresponding values represent **conditions** those fields must meet.

**Analogy:** Think of `$match` like setting up a filter in a spreadsheet. You specify which column (`stage`) should meet certain conditions (`$exists: true`).

### 2. `$group` Stage: Using `"$stage"` With `$`

```javascript
$group: {
  _id: "$stage",
  count: { $sum: 1 }
}
```

- **Purpose:** The `$group` stage aggregates documents based on specified criteria.
- **Usage of `"$stage"`:**
  - **`"$stage"` as `_id`:** Here, `"$stage"` refers to the **value** of the `stage` field in each document. By prefixing `stage` with `$`, you're telling MongoDB to **use the value of the `stage` field** for grouping.
  - **`count: { $sum: 1 }`:** This counts the number of documents in each group.

- **`$` Prefix Meaning:**
  - In aggregation expressions (like in `$group`, `$project`, `$addFields`, etc.), the `$` prefix is used to **reference the value of a field** in the current document.
  - It tells MongoDB to **access the value** of the `stage` field rather than treating it as a literal string.

**Analogy:** Imagine you're categorizing items based on their `stage` value. The `$group` stage uses the actual values (e.g., "Seedling", "Mature") to create groups.

## Summary of `$` Usage

| Context       | Usage          | Example                | Explanation                                                   |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **$match**    | Field Name     | `{ stage: { $exists: true } }` | Specifies conditions based on **field names** and their criteria. No `$` needed for field names. |
| **$group**    | Field Value    | `"$stage"`             | References the **value** of a field. `$` is used to access the field's value for aggregation. |
| **$project**  | Field Value    | `"$stage"`             | Similar to `$group`, used to include or transform field values. |
| **Expressions** | Field Value | `"$fieldName"`        | In any aggregation expression, `$` is used to reference field values. |

## Practical Example with Explanation

Let's consider an example with the `trees` collection:

### Sample Documents

```json
[
  { "_id": 1, "type": "Oak", "stage": "Seedling" },
  { "_id": 2, "type": "Pine", "stage": "Sapling" },
  { "_id": 3, "type": "Birch" }, // Missing 'stage'
  { "_id": 4, "type": "Oak", "stage": "Mature" },
  { "_id": 5, "type": "Pine", "stage": "Sapling" },
  { "_id": 6, "type": "Birch" }  // Missing 'stage'
]
```

### Aggregation Pipeline Execution

1. **$match Stage:**

   ```javascript
   { stage: { $exists: true } }
   ```

   - **Result:** Filters out documents missing the `stage` field.
   - **Matched Documents:**
     - `{ "_id": 1, "type": "Oak", "stage": "Seedling" }`
     - `{ "_id": 2, "type": "Pine", "stage": "Sapling" }`
     - `{ "_id": 4, "type": "Oak", "stage": "Mature" }`
     - `{ "_id": 5, "type": "Pine", "stage": "Sapling" }`

2. **$group Stage:**

   ```javascript
   {
     _id: "$stage",
     count: { $sum: 1 }
   }
   ```

   - **Groups Documents by `stage` Value:**
     - `"Seedling"`: 1 document
     - `"Sapling"`: 2 documents
     - `"Mature"`: 1 document
   - **Result:**

     ```json
     [
       { "_id": "Seedling", "count": 1 },
       { "_id": "Sapling", "count": 2 },
       { "_id": "Mature", "count": 1 }
     ]
     ```

### Why Use `$` in `$group`?

- **Without `$`:** Using `_id: "stage"` would group all documents under the literal string `"stage"`.

  ```javascript
  { _id: "stage", count: { $sum: 1 } }
  ```

  **Result:**

  ```json
  [
    { "_id": "stage", "count": 4 }
  ]
  ```

  - **Interpretation:** All matched documents are grouped under the key `"stage"`, giving a total count of 4.

- **With `$`:** Using `_id: "$stage"` groups documents based on the actual values of the `stage` field.

  ```javascript
  { _id: "$stage", count: { $sum: 1 } }
  ```

  **Result:**

  ```json
  [
    { "_id": "Seedling", "count": 1 },
    { "_id": "Sapling", "count": 2 },
    { "_id": "Mature", "count": 1 }
  ]
  ```

  - **Interpretation:** Documents are grouped by their `stage` values, providing counts for each category.

## Visualizing the Difference

| Stage        | Without `$` (`"stage"`) | With `$` (`"$stage"`)               |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**  | Group by literal string  | Group by field value                |
| **Example**  | All documents under `"stage"` | Documents grouped by `"Seedling"`, `"Sapling"`, etc. |
| **Result**   | Single group with total count | Multiple groups with counts per `stage` value |

## Additional Tips

1. **Consistent Usage:**
   - **Field Names:** Use field names without `$` when specifying them as keys in operators like `$match`, `$sort`, etc.
   - **Field Values:** Use `$` when referencing the value of a field within expressions, such as in `$group`, `$project`, `$addFields`, etc.

2. **Common Mistakes:**
   - **Forgetting `$` in Expressions:** Not using `$` when referencing field values in expressions can lead to unexpected results.
   - **Using `$` in Field Names:** Conversely, using `$` when specifying field names in operators like `$match` can cause errors.

3. **Understanding Context:**
   - The presence or absence of `$` changes the meaning based on where and how it's used in the pipeline.

## Conclusion

- **`stage` Without `$`:** Refers to the **field name** in the document. Used when specifying criteria or operations based on the field itself.

  ```javascript
  $match: { stage: { $exists: true } }
  ```

- **`"$stage"` With `$`:** Refers to the **value** of the `stage` field in each document. Used when you need to perform operations based on the field's value, such as grouping or projecting.

  ```javascript
  $group: { _id: "$stage", count: { $sum: 1 } }
  ```

By understanding the context in which to use the `$` prefix, you can construct more accurate and efficient aggregation pipelines in MongoDB.
