# Solution for the practice on aggregation pipelines over sample_analytics


## connect

Connect to the `sample_analytics` database on ATLAS using `mongosh`


```bash
mongosh mongodb+srv://<username>:<db_password>@<server>.mongodb.net/sample_analytics
```


## Context

The data is

The `sample_analytics` database has three main collections with clear relationships:

- `accounts` ⟷ `customers`: linked via `account_id`
- `accounts` ⟷ `transactions`: linked via `account_id`

So `transactions` can be joined to `accounts`, which can be joined to `customers`, allowing analysis of customer behavior and account activity.


```js
show collections
```

```bash
accounts
customers
transactions
```

Let's look at the schema of each collection with `db.<collection>.findOne()` and count the documents in each collection with `ddb.<collection>.countDocuments()`



- 500 customers

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId('5ca4bbcea2dd94ee58162a6a'),
  username: 'hillrachel',
  name: 'Katherine David',
  address: '55711 Janet Plaza Apt. 865\nChristinachester, CT 62716',
  birthdate: ISODate('1988-06-20T22:15:34.000Z'),
  email: 'timothy78@hotmail.com',
  accounts: [ 462501, 228290, 968786, 515844, 377292 ],
  tier_and_details: {}
}
```

A customer has multiple accounts as shown in the `customer.accounts` array.

- 1746 accounts

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId('5ca4bbc7a2dd94ee58162394'),
  account_id: 487188,
  limit: 10000,
  products: [ 'Brokerage', 'CurrencyService', 'InvestmentStock' ]
}
```

- 1746 transactions

```js
{
  _id: ObjectId('5ca4bbc1a2dd94ee58161cc7'),
  account_id: 55958,
  transaction_count: 10,
  bucket_start_date: ISODate('2001-10-02T00:00:00.000Z'),
  bucket_end_date: ISODate('2016-12-15T00:00:00.000Z'),
  transactions: [
    {
      date: ISODate('2016-10-25T00:00:00.000Z'),
      amount: 4903,
      transaction_code: 'buy',
      symbol: 'goog',
      price: '809.2527258697388106156722642481327056884765625',
      total: '3967766.114939329388448641112'
    },
    //
    // .... many transactions (8)
    //
    {
      date: ISODate('2014-10-31T00:00:00.000Z'),
      amount: 1601,
      transaction_code: 'sell',
      symbol: 'goog',
      price: '555.472948483338541336706839501857757568359375',
      total: '889312.1905218250046800676500'
    }
  ]
}
```

A transaction document has many transactions. maybe not the best naming convention. This is quite confusing in fact.

## Queries


### 1. Find the total number of transactions per account

aka check that all `account_id` in the transactions collection are unique (or not).

from the transactions collection, find the total number of transactions per account (group by account_id), sort to get the accounts with most transactions, limit to 5.

## Total transactions per account:

```bash
db.transactions.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: "$account_id",
      total_transactions: { $count: {} }
    }
  },
  {
    $sort : { "total_transactions" : -1}
  },
  {
    $limit : 5
  }
])
```

returns

```js
[
  { _id: `627788`, total_transactions: 2 },
  { _id: 736326, total_transactions: 1 },
  { _id: 240753, total_transactions: 1 },
  { _id: 794675, total_transactions: 1 },
  { _id: 463278, total_transactions: 1 }
]
```

There is only one account (`627788`) that has 2 transaction documents.

a

```js
db.transaction.find({ account_id : 627788 }, {account_id: 1, transaction_count: 1})
```

returns the 2 documents.

```js
[
  {
    _id: ObjectId('5ca4bbc1a2dd94ee58162211'),
    account_id: 627788,
    transaction_count: 54
  },
  {
    _id: ObjectId('5ca4bbc1a2dd94ee58162320'),
    account_id: 627788,
    transaction_count: 22
  }
]
```

### 2. List all customers with their account balances

We want to find the balances of


```js
db.accounts.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "account_id",
      foreignField: "account_id",
      as: "customer_info"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      account_id: 1,
      balance: 1,
      "customer_info.name": 1
    }
  }
])

```




2. Find accounts with transactions over $10,000

3. Calculate the average transaction amount by product type

4. Identify customers who have multiple accounts

5. Find the top 3 accounts with highest transaction volume in each product category

6. List customers who made transactions in foreign currencies, showing their home currency

7. Calculate monthly transaction totals per account, showing account type and customer name

8. Identify accounts with unusual transaction patterns (frequency or amount significantly above average)

9.  Generate a customer activity report showing: total accounts, transaction volume, average transaction size, and most used transaction types - grouped by customer organization


Let's do the first 3 queries:


## Customers with account balances:

```bash
db.accounts.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "customers",
      localField: "account_id",
      foreignField: "account_id",
      as: "customer_info"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      account_id: 1,
      balance: 1,
      "customer_info.name": 1
    }
  }
])
```

## Accounts with large transactions:

```bash
db.transactions.aggregate([
  {
    $match: {
      transaction_amount: { $gt: 10000 }
    }
  },
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "accounts",
      localField: "account_id",
      foreignField: "account_id",
      as: "account_info"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      account_id: 1,
      transaction_amount: 1,
      "account_info.account_type": 1
    }
  }
])
```
