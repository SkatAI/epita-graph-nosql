## Last time

- discussion on when to choose MongoDB over SQL
  - OLAP vs OLTP -> contrary to feeling, OLTP is more adapted than OLAP
  - Flexible Schema, data structure evolution
  - Good when working on Single document
- Aggregation pipelines
  - see the [aggregation pipeline cheatsheet](https://github.com/SkatAI/epita-mongodb/blob/master/docs/cheatsheet_aggregation_pipelines_mongodb.md)
