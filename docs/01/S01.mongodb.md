# MongoDB

<https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community>

download from

<https://fastdl.mongodb.org/osx/mongodb-macos-arm64-8.0.3.tgz>

MongoDB Community Edition is indeed the free, open-source version of MongoDB that you can run locally on your machine. However, it's important to note that MongoDB Atlas is different - it's MongoDB's cloud database service. Think of it this way:

MongoDB Community Edition = Self-hosted, runs on your computer
MongoDB Atlas = Cloud-hosted service with both free and paid tiers

For teaching purposes, I recommend installing both:

MongoDB Community Edition - for understanding local database operations
MongoDB Compass - the GUI tool that makes visualization and interaction easier for students

Install on local

```bash
# First update Homebrew
brew update

# Install MongoDB Community Edition
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community

# Start MongoDB service
brew services start mongodb-community
```

Then install MongoDB Compass (the GUI tool):

Go to <https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass>
Download the Intel or Apple Silicon version depending on your Mac
Install it like any other Mac application

then

Part 2: Create Your First Collection (10 minutes)
Let's create a fun little music playlist database!

In Compass:

Click "Create Database"
Database name: music_db
Collection name: songs

Open Terminal/Command Prompt and run:
// Connect to MongoDB
mongosh

// Switch to our database
use music_db

// Insert your first song
db.songs.insertOne({
    title: "Happy",
    artist: "Pharrell Williams",
    year: 2013,
    mood: "joyful",
    lastPlayed: new Date()
})

Add a few more songs using Compass's interface:

db.songs.insertOne({
    "title": "Don't Stop Believin'",
    "artist": "Journey",
    "year": 1981,
    "mood": "inspiring",
    "lastPlayed": new Date()
})

Try these commands in mongosh:

Find all songs:

db.songs.find()

db.songs.find({ year: { $lt: 2000 } })

db.songs.countDocuments()

In Compass to add a record put the fields after the {_id}

```json
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "673f1f5b2adc93eb7abc7598"
  },
  "title": "Don't Stop Believin'",
  "artist": "Journey",
  "year": 1981,
  "mood": "inspiring"
}
```

In compass query is also a json object

## NoSQL terminology

| MongoDB | SQL Database |
|----------|--------------|
| Database | Database |
| Collection | Table |
| Document | Record/Row |
| Field | Column |
| Index | Index |
| Embedded Document | Foreign Key |
| `$lookup` | JOIN |
| `_id` | Primary Key |
| Sharding | Partitioning |

A document is a record, a row
A Collection is a table
A Fields is a Column

Sharding is the process of splitting large datasets across multiple servers (shards) in MongoDB to ensure scalability and performance. It allows MongoDB to handle large amounts of data and high query loads by distributing the data across a cluster of servers.

## Querying

key equivalents between Mongodb and SQL

SELECT * FROM users

db.users.find()

SELECT * FROM users WHERE age = 21

db.users.find({ age: 21 })

SELECT name, age FROM users

db.users.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1 })

SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 21 ORDER BY name ASC
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 21 }}).sort({ name: 1 })

INSERT INTO users(name, age) VALUES ("John", 25)
db.users.insertOne({ name: "John", age: 25 })

UPDATE users SET age = 26 WHERE name = "John"
db.users.updateOne({ name: "John" }, { $set: { age: 26 }})

DELETE FROM users WHERE name = "John"
db.users.deleteOne({ name: "John" })

-- multiple rows

-- SQL Multiple Records
SELECT * FROM users WHERE age > 25;
UPDATE users SET status = 'active' WHERE city = 'Paris';
DELETE FROM users WHERE lastLogin < '2023-01-01';
INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('John', 25), ('Jane', 30);

becomes

// MongoDB Multiple Documents
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 }});

db.users.updateMany(
  { city: "Paris" },
  { $set: { status: "active" }}
);

db.users.deleteMany({
  lastLogin: { $lt: new Date('2023-01-01') }
});

db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "John", age: 25 },
  { name: "Jane", age: 30 }
]);

=> TODO exercise on simple dataset

### differences betwen SQL and MongoDB queries

Complex queries:

SQL JOINs vs MongoDB $lookup behave differently
Nested/embedded documents in MongoDB have no direct SQL equivalent
MongoDB aggregation pipeline syntax differs significantly from SQL GROUP BY

Transaction handling:

MongoDB's transaction model is more limited than SQL
ACID properties are handled differently

Data modification:

MongoDB allows partial updates more naturally ($set, $inc etc.)
Array operations in MongoDB have no direct SQL equivalent
