# Aggregation Pipelines

The `find()` method on a collection is limited. It can't group or transform the documents.


There are  also single purpose methods like `estimatedDocumentCount()`,  `count()`, and `distinct()` which are appended to a `find()` query making them quick to use but limited in scope.

Up until version 5.0, you could also use the map-reduce framework on MongoDB. But it's deprecated and out of scope for this course.

> Starting in MongoDB 5.0, map-reduce is deprecated: Instead of map-reduce, you should use an aggregation pipeline. Aggregation pipelines provide better performance and usability than map-reduce.
> https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/map-reduce/

**Aggregation pipelines** are powerful.

An **aggregation pipeline** consists of one or more stages that process documents.

- Each stage performs an operation on the input documents : (filtering, grouping, projecting, transforming, ...)
- Each stage output is the input for the next stage.

<div style='display: left; margin-left: 30px; '>

<img src="./../img/aggregation_pipeline.png" width='70%' style='display: left; margin: auto; ' alt= "aggregation pipeline steps for rertrieval">

from https://studio3t.com/knowledge-base/articles/mongodb-aggregation-framework/
</div>

Main stages:

- `$match` stage – filters those documents we need to work with, those that fit our needs
- `$group` stage – does the aggregation job
- `$sort`  stage – sorts the resulting documents the way we require (ascending or descending)


A pipeline is executed with the  `aggregate()` method and a list of JSON objects.

```bash
db.collectionName.aggregate(pipeline, options),
```

where

```bash
pipeline = [
        { $match : { … } },
        { $group : { … } },
        { $sort : { … } }
       ]
```

## Memory constraints and outputs

[TODO] not clear

The results of a pipeline are  a cursor or stored via $out in another collection,

2 memory constraints :


> 1. Aggregation works in memory. Each stage can use up to 100 MB of RAM.
> 2. The documents returned by the aggregation query are limited to 16MB. They can’t be bigger than the maximum size of a MongoDB document.

If you are likely to exceed this limit, then you should specify that the output of the aggregation query will be as a cursor and not as a document.

Also : add .pretty() to end of command to make it ... pretty

## Aggregation Pipeline operators

### MongoDB $group aggregation operators

The $group stage supports certain expressions (operators) allowing users to perform arithmetic, array, boolean and other operations as part of the aggregation pipeline.

| Operator | Meaning                                                       |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| $count   | Calculates the quantity of documents in the given group.      |
| $max     | Displays the maximum value of a document’s field in the collection. |
| $min     | Displays the minimum value of a document’s field in the collection. |
| $avg     | Displays the average value of a document’s field in the collection. |
| $sum     | Sums up the specified values of all documents in the collection. |
| $push    | Adds extra values into the array of the resulting document.   |

[TODO] needs example and practice


### $unwind

MongoDB $unwind

The $unwind stage in MongoDB is commonly found in a pipeline because it is a means to an end.

You cannot work directly on the elements of an array within a document with stages such as $group. The $unwind stage enables us to work with the values of the fields within an array.

[TODO] needs example and practice

### $addFields

Sometimes you may need to make changes to your output in the way of new fields.

see also : $sortByCount, $facet
[TODO] needs example and practice

### $out

MongoDB $out

This is an unusual type of stage because it allows you to carry the results of your aggregation over into a new collection, or into an existing one after dropping it, or even adding them to the existing documents.

The $out stage must be the last stage in the pipeline.

For the first time, we are using an aggregation with more than one stage. We now have two, a $group and an $out:

db.universities.aggregate([
  { $group : { _id : '$name', totaldocs : { $sum : 1 } } },
  { $out : 'aggResults' }
])

Now, we check the content of the new ‘aggResults’ collection:

db.aggResults.find().pretty()

{ "_id" : "UPSA", "totaldocs" : 1 }
{ "_id" : "USAL", "totaldocs" : 1 }

### Example

Best to look at an example

```javascript
cursor = db.movies.aggregate([
    {
        $match: { imdb.rating: { $gt: 8.0 } }
    },
    {
        $project: {
            _id: 0,
            title : 1,
            imdb.rating: 1,
            released: 1
        }
    },
    {
        $sort: { released: -1 }
    },
    {
        $limit: 2
    }
])
```

Using the  `find()` method, the equivalent query with is

```python
db.movies.find(
    { "imdb.rating": { "$gt": 8.0 } },
    { "_id": 0, "title": 1, "imdb.rating": 1, "released": 1 }
).sort(
    { "released": -1 }
).limit(
    2
)
```


## Movies aggregation pipeline

![Movies Pipeline](./../img/movies-pipeline-vertical.png)

which corresponds to the pipeline

```bash
db.movies.aggregate([
    {
        "$match": {
            "imdb.rating": { "$gt": 8.0 },
            "year": { "$gte": 2000 }
        }
    },
    {
        "$unwind": "$genres"
    },
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": "$genres",
            "averageRating": { "$avg": "$imdb.rating" },
            "movieCount": { "$sum": 1 },
            "topDirectors": {
                "$push": {
                    "director": "$directors",
                    "movie": "$title",
                    "rating": "$imdb.rating"
                }
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "$match": {
            "movieCount": { "$gte": 5 }
        }
    },
    {
        "$project": {
            "_id": 0,
            "genre": "$_id",
            "averageRating": 1,
            "movieCount": 1,
            "topMovies": { "$slice": ["$topDirectors", 3] }
        }
    },
    {
        "$sort": {
            "averageRating": -1
        }
    },
    {
        "$limit": 5
    }
])
```

### Joins and $lookups

In MongoDB, joins over collections are obtained with `$lookup `.

Here's an example of joining the movies with their comments using a `$lookup` stage.


```bash
db.movies.aggregate([
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "comments",           // The collection to join
            localField: "_id",          // The field in the `movies` collection
            foreignField: "movie_id",   // The field in the `comments` collection
            as: "movie_comments"        // Name of the resulting array
        }
    },
    {
        $match: {                      // Filter the movies to include only those with a high IMDb rating
            "imdb.rating": { $gte: 8 }
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {                    // Project only the fields of interest
            _id: 0,
            title: 1,
            "imdb.rating": 1,
            movie_comments: 1
        }
    }
])

```

If we want to

- only return movies with some comments
- and only return a maximum of 2 comments per movies

```javascript
db.movies.aggregate([
    {
        $lookup: {
            from: "comments",           // The collection to join
            localField: "_id",          // The field in the movies collection
            foreignField: "movie_id",   // The field in the comments collection
            as: "movie_comments"        // The resulting array field
        }
    },
    {
        $addFields: {
            movie_comments: { $slice: ["$movie_comments", 2] }  // Limit comments to 2
        }
    },
    {
        $match: {                      // Only include movies with at least 1 comment
            movie_comments: { $ne: [] }
        }
    },
    {
        $project: {                    // Project only the fields of interest
            _id: 0,
            title: 1,
            movie_comments: 1
        }
    }
])
```

- $lookup:
  - Joins the movies collection with the comments collection based on `_id` in movies and `movie_id` in comments.
  - Adds an array field `movie_comments` containing all comments for each movie.

- $addFields:
  - Uses `$slice` to limit the `movie_comments` array to a maximum of 2 comments.

- $match:
  - Filters out movies with no comments by ensuring movie_comments is not an empty array ($ne: []).

- $project:
  - Specifies the fields to include in the final result, such as title and movie_comments.


#### Let's practice

And build the pipeline for the request :

> Find all movies with their comments and commenter details, showing only movies that have at least one comment, sorted by number of comments. and add the number of comments as a new field


##### Start with

- get the movie title, year and comments
- limit to 3 movies

```bash
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "comments",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "movie_id",
      as: "movie_comments"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: 1,
      year: 1,
      comments: "$movie_comments.text"
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 3
  }
])
```

This returns movies with many empty comments

- at least one comment

add condition so that it returns movies with at least one comment (not empty arrays)

```bash
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "comments",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "movie_id",
      as: "movie_comments"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: 1,
      year: 1,
      comments: "$movie_comments.text"
    }
  },
  {
    $match : {
        comments : { $ne: [] }
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 3
  }
])
```

- add number of comments as new field

```bash
db.movies.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "comments",
      localField: "_id",
      foreignField: "movie_id",
      as: "movie_comments"
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      title: 1,
      year: 1,
      comments: "$movie_comments.text"
    }
  },
  {
    $match : {
        comments : { $ne: [] }
    }
  },
  {
    $limit: 3
  }
])
```


### Unwinding an array

For instance, let's calculate the average imdb rating per genre

```javascript
db.movies.aggregate([
    {
        $unwind: "$genres"
    },
    {
        $group: {
            _id: "$genres",                 // Group by genre
            average_rating: { $avg: "$imdb.rating" },  // Calculate average IMDb rating
            movie_count: { $sum: 1 }        // Count the number of movies in each genre
        }
    },
    {
        $sort: { average_rating: -1 }      // Sort genres by average rating (descending)
    }
])
```

- $unwind:
  - Breaks the genres array into multiple documents, each with a single genre.
  - If a movie has ["Action", "Drama"] in genres, it will become two documents:

    { "title": "Movie A", "genres": "Action" }

    { "title": "Movie A", "genres": "Drama" }

- $match:
  - Filters the documents to include only those where genres is "Action".

- $project:
  - Includes only the fields of interest (title, genres, and imdb.rating) in the output.

- $sort:
  - Orders the results by IMDb rating in descending order.

Use `$unwind` when you need to deconstruct array fields for downstream operations like grouping, sorting, or filtering...

### aggregation pipelines go beyond simple queries

While there is some overlap, aggregation pipelines offer more powerful and flexible data transformation and computation capabilities than the simpler query methods.

`find()` queries are limited to filtering documents and optionally projecting fields (including or excluding).

Aggregation pipelines are used for multiple tasks:

- **Data Transformation** :  reshape documents, perform calculations, and add new fields using stages like `$project`, `$group`, and `$addFields`.

  ```json
  [
    { "$group": { "_id": "$genre", "averageRuntime": { "$avg": "$runtime" } } }
  ]
  ```

- **Field Manipulation**: `$unset` in aggregation allows removing fields from documents instead of doing it with projections.

- **Joining collections**:
  ```json
  [
    { "$lookup": { "from": "authors", "localField": "authorId", "foreignField": "_id", "as": "authorDetails" } }
  ]
  ```

- **Document Flow** :  Aggregation pipelines process documents through multiple stages, applying transformations at each stage.

- **Performance**: Aggregation pipelines can leverage stages like `$merge` or `$out` to save results into a new collection, useful for data processing pipelines.

### Group and Total

This follows this [aggregation pipeline tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/current/aggregation/aggregation-tutorials/group-total/)


Let's calculate average IMDb rating and Count total movies for each year.

We define the aggregation pipeline


```python
pipeline = [
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": "$year",  # Group by the "year" field
            "average_imdb_rating": {"$avg": "$imdb.rating"},  # Calculate average IMDb rating
            "total_movies": {"$sum": 1}  # Count total movies for each year
        }
    },
    {
        "$sort": {"_id": 1}  # Sort by year in ascending order
    }
]
```

Then execute it the aggregation pipeline

```python
cursor = db.movies.aggregate(pipeline)
for doc in cursor:
    print(doc)
```

we see that we have weird values for years. Strings values with an extra `é`!

So let's find all the weird years. We can use regex

```python
cursor = db.movies.find({"year": {"$regex": "è"}})
```

but we could also check the data type of the field

```python
pipeline = [
    {"$group": {"_id": {"type": {"$type": "$year"}}, "count": {"$sum": 1}}}
]
```

Which returns

```bash
{'_id': {'type': 'string'}, 'count': 35}
{'_id': {'type': 'int'}, 'count': 21314}
```

Which shows that in MongoDB we can mix data types!

If we want to avoid counting the years that are not ints, we can add a $match clause.
The initial pipeline becomes


```python
pipeline = [
    {
        "$match": {  # Ensure "year" is an integer
            "year": { "$type": "int" }
        }
    },
    {
        "$group": {
            "_id": "$year",  # Group by the "year" field
            "average_imdb_rating": {"$avg": "$imdb.rating"},  # Calculate average IMDb rating
            "total_movies": {"$sum": 1}  # Count total movies for each year
        }
    },
    {
        "$sort": {"_id": 1}  # Sort by year in ascending order
    }
]
```

It looks like old movies are better than recent ones
