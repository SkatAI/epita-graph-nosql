# Scope

# on importing food dataset
# For large datasets, always use mongorestore with BSON files rather than mongoimport with JSON
# BSON is MongoDB's binary format and is much faster to process
# If your data is in JSON, you might want to do a local import to MongoDB first, then dump and restore

next:
  - summarize doc for each topic below as lesson in mongodb deep dive
  - [S01] set practice on Atlas sample
  - [S01] missing some basic querying on db.
  - [S02] from https://learn.mongodb.com/pages/learners-journey select topics
    - CRUD in python
      - notebook on CRUD over Atlas Sample
    - aggregation, (30mn)
      - [S02] set worksheet on food dataset for aggregation and querying

      - can I use my atlas clusrer, do I need a bigger cluster
    - indexes,
    - schema design
      - set worksheet on Airbnb data for schema design
  - [S03] vector search

outline:
  session 01: mongodb on cloud. CRUD.
  session 02: mongodb on local - advanced topics - airbnb
  session 03: open food - vector search - in mongodb - quiz
  session 04: graph db Neo4J - intro

need to cover:
  - mongodb:
    level 1: similar to sql; CRUD; find, insert, update, joins, create
    level 2: performance optimization; indexing; query plans,
    level 3: cloud, sharding
    schema design: embedding vs referencing, https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/mongodb-schema-design-best-practices/
    time series: would make a good IoT example
    vector search: in mongodb, compare with weaviate

  json vs document: |
    - is a `document` exactly similar to a json record. what about jsonl.
    - could we use yaml or XML
