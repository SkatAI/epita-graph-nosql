need to cover:
  - mongodb:
    level 1: similar to sql; CRUD; find, insert, update, joins, create
    level 2: performance optimization; indexing; query plans,
    level 3: cloud, sharding
    schema design: embedding vs referencing, https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/mongodb-schema-design-best-practices/
    time series: wouldd make a good IoT example
    vector search: in mongodb, compare with weaviate
    aggregation & indexing: see book on FARM @packt and example at  https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/optimizing-lookup-performance-using-power-of-indexing/
    sharding vs repliccation: https://www.cloudactivelabs.com/en/blog/mongodb-replication-vs-sharding-when-to-choose-which
    Concurrency Issues: how to deala nd prevent them
    Data Validation Errors: hpw to validate the data before inserting it

questions:
  json vs document: |
    - is a `document` exactly similar to a json record. what about jsonl.
    - could we use yaml or XML
  performance optimization: |
    - how do you optimise mongodb database and collection perf

datasets:
  sample atlas datasets: https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/atlas/atlas-sample-datasets/

resources:
  relational vs no sql: https://www.enterprisedb.com/choosing-mongodb-postgresql-cloud-database-solutions-guide
  connect to mongodb on compass: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/compass/current/connect/
  convert queries from SQL to mongoDB: up to somme complexity it's rerally the same see example

  schema design: |
    Schema Design Approaches â€“ Relational vs. MongoDB
