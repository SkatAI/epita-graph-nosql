# NoSQL and graph databases

This course covers two types of non SQL databases: Neo4j a graph database and MongoDB

We will also talk about vector search which is a key component of LLMs.

Before we dive into these 2 specific and amazing tools / platforms, the question is

> What is a database ?

TODO: img : big bang + sheldon what is a database?

Is a spreadsheet a database ?

I've heard people talk about a CSV or excel file as a database. And it makes me cringe.
How can something so simple as a CSV file can be put on the same level as engineering wonders such as PostgresSQL, Weaviate, MongoDB, Neo4j, Redis etc ...

So I asked my dear friend GPT-4o, to give me a definition of a database and this is what it told me

> In layman's terms:
  "A database is like a smart notebook or filing system that helps you keep track of lots of information and find exactly what you need in no time."

which definitely includes csv files, excel files, json files, XML files and so many other simple formats based on one file.

If we look for the definition of a database in a more classic and venerable source of knowledge, such as [Britanica](https://www.britannica.com/technology/database) we get:

> database, any collection of data, or information, that is specially organized for rapid search and retrieval by a computer. Databases are structured to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction with various data-processing operations.

See also the database article on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database).

Very interesting. we're no longer talking about finding information quickly (the retrieval part) but also

- storage
- modification
- deletion

and Administration.

That's where a simple spreadsheet no longer fits the purpose.

## What we expect from a DBMS

DBMS: database management system

| Feature                | Description                                                                     | Excel | DBMS |

## A brief history of databases 1970-2024

> tldr; Our course starts in 2009, 15 years ago and 20 years after PostgreSQL was born.

![evolution of databases](/img/evolution-of-databases.png)



### 1970s - The Relational Era Begins

- **1970**: **[Edgar Codd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd)** publishes "[A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks](https://github.com/SkatAI/epita-graph-nosql/blob/master/pdfs/codd.pdf)"
- **1974**: **IBM** develops System R, the first SQL DBMS prototype
- **1979**: **Oracle** releases the first commercial SQL implementation

### 1980s - Relational Dominance

- **1989**: Postgres (now [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)) development begins at UC Berkeley
  - üéñÔ∏èüéñÔ∏èüéñÔ∏è best in class multi purpose database.
  - can handle no-sql & vector,
  - many extensions (http, postgis, ...).
  - amazing performance.
  - and OPEN SOURCE (free, effficient and secure).
  - I ‚ù§Ô∏è PostgreSQL.

### 1990s - Object-Oriented Wave

- **1991**: Object-Oriented Databases gain attention. Most OODBs from the 90's are no longer used. But they influenced evolution of SQl and NoSQL database.
- **1995**: MySQL released as open source

### 2000s - The NoSQL Revolution Begins

- 2 important papers for future NoSQL systems: [BigTable paper](https://research.google.com/archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf) (Google, 2004) and [Dynamo paper](https://www.amazon.science/publications/dynamo-amazons-highly-available-key-value-store) (Amazon, 2007)

And in **2009**, 2 new databases are released:

- ü•≠ü•≠ü•≠ MongoDB
- üéâüéâüéâ Neo4j

#### Why the need for Non SQL databases?

The rise of the world wide web (myspace LOL) and the massive scale up of applications by orders of magnitude.

All of a sudden, we have millions of people at the same time trying to access and modify Terabytes of data in milliseconds.

Relational databases can't keep up with the scale of applications, the chaotic unstructured data and the speed requirement.

While all DBMS need to ensure: Scalability, Reliability, and Performance, the promise of NoSQL is **volume and speed**.


### 2010s - NoSQL Matures & Specialization - Big Data and Specialized Databases

- **Big Data Databases**: Systems like Apache Hadoop (2006) and Apache Spark (2009) supported massive-scale data processing.
- **Graph Databases Gain Popularity:** with use cases such as fraud detection, knowledge graphs, and supply chain management. Neo4j and Amazon Neptune become key players.
- **Time-Series Databases (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB):** designed for monitoring systems: IoT, logs, ...
- **Cloud Databases:** managed services like Amazon RDS, Google **BigQuery**, or Snowflake

and in the meantime, in 2013, Docker containers revolutionize database deployment

### **2020s: AI, Vector Databases, and Real-Time Needs**

- **Vector Databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate):**
  - Developed for managing high-dimensional vector embeddings used in AI/ML applications
  - Purpose-built for the rise of AI models like OpenAI GPT and embedding-based search.

- and also :
  - Multi-Model Databases that support multiple data models (document, graph, key-value) in one system.
  - Graph + AI: knowledge graphs and reasoning.
  - Real-Time Analytics: optimized for real-time streaming data and analytics.
  - Serverless Databases

### Current Trends (2024)

Vector search is all the rage. Vector search capabilities are integrated in most existing DBMS. PostgreSQL, MongDB and Neo4j included.


![evolution of databases](/img/epita-atabase-evolution-2024-11-21-062329.png)

## Key Database Categories Today

We have many databases to choose from. It all depends on the scale, the nature of the application, budget, etc

| Database Type          | Purpose                                | Examples                | Application                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Document Stores**     | Flexible schema, JSON-like documents  | MongoDB, CouchDB        | Web applications, content management |
| **Graph Databases**     | Relationship-focused data             | Neo4j, ArangoDB         | Social networks, recommendation engines |
| **Key-Value Stores**    | Simple, fast lookups                  | Redis, DynamoDB         | Caching, session management          |
| **Vector Databases**    | Similarity search, AI embeddings      | Pinecone, Weaviate      | AI applications, semantic search     |
| **Column-Family Stores**| Wide-column data, high scalability    | Cassandra, HBase        | Time-series, big data applications   |
| **Time-Series Databases**| Time-ordered data                    | InfluxDB, TimescaleDB   | IoT, monitoring systems              |

## Relation vs non relational database

A relational database is like a well-organized spreadsheet where every column is defined, and tables can connect with each other.  use a predefined **schema**, meaning the structure of the data (columns, data types, etc.) is fixed.
Great for complex queries, transactions, and ensuring data consistency (ACID compliance).
tight. under control. data is consistent.

A non-relational database is like a flexible folder system where you can store items in different shapes and forms without strict rules. fluid, adaptive, letting go. Ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data, high scalability, and handling massive, distributed workloads.


### SQL

In a SQL database, we have a table within a database that has columns and rows of data.
A table has a unique key called the **primary key**.
A normalized database (a piece of data exists only in one table) uses foreign keys to reference (link) tables together.

hierarchy:

- A foreign key column links a column in one table to another table
- A row of data is the entity or the data value
- A column is an attribute or property of the entity
- A table holds all the entities that are grouped together in a fixed structure of columns
- Tables exist within a database

In NoSQL

we have a collection that has documents.
Each collection has a unique key  (the _id field)
Within a document, you may have subdocuments and these subdocuments are data related to the document itself (for an example, a list of addresses that a person has).

hierarchy:

- A document is the entity or data value
- A subdocument is a child document **within** a parent document. **embedded**
- A field is an attribute or property of the document
- A collection holds all the document that are grouped together in a semi-fixed structure of columns
- Collections exist within a database



## Schema-less or dynamic schema

Why do we need a special type of database when the data structure is dynamic

Example of a start up like Yuka

lots of information about food products

in a constant evolving context

data evolves fast

- new data becomes available as actors implement data collection. think traceability, safety, etc
- new regulations impose more data
- news, social trends and focus changes rapidly (gluten free, tuna and mercury, )

So you start your database with simple things like

- name, definition, image, description
- nutritional values
- etc

Then nutriscore changes. so you need new nutriscore
but keep the old one.

but not all products implement new nutriscore

let's say you have a nutriscore table

product_id
nutriscore_label
date

so you nutriscore table needs a  new tag, a new column
product_id
nutriscore_label
nutriscore_new_label
date

ok but a lot of products don't have a new nutriscore
so there's plenty of null values in that nutriscore_new_label column
and null values are evil

Side Question: what's wrong with the table above ? how can you avoid having null values at all ?

Question is : is MongoDB only about avoiding null values ?

So is the main justification for mongodb vs sql when the data has varying attributes ?

Which would mean a lot of either unknown columns popping up and requiring database changes or lots of null values in existing columns ?

- Schema Flexibility ("Unknown Columns"):

In SQL: If you have a Products table and suddenly need to add "allergens" for food items but not for electronics, you'd either:

- Add a column that's NULL for many products
- Create separate tables (ProductFood, ProductElectronics) leading to complexity

In MongoDB: You can just add allergens to food products:

```json
// Food product
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Peanut Butter",
  "price": 4.99,
  "allergens": ["peanuts"]
}

// Electronic product
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "Headphones",
  "price": 59.99,
  "warranty_months": 12
}
```

Nested/Complex Data:

- SQL requires normalization into multiple tables for complex structures
- MongoDB can nest related data naturally

```json
{
  "order_id": 123,
  "customer": {
    "name": "John",
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Boston"
    }
  },
  "items": [
    {
      "product": "Phone",
      "quantity": 1,
      "custom_engraving": "John's iPhone"
    },
    {
      "product": "Case",
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

Rapid Iteration:

- When your application is evolving quickly and data requirements change often
- Startups or new products where the data model isn't fully understood yet
- A/B testing different features that might require different data structures

MongoDB is about avoiding normalization

> The advantage of No_SQL database over SQL databases (MongoDB over PostgreSQL) is that no-sql database do not expect or require normalization

The key advantage of MongoDB over SQL databases is that it doesn't require strict normalization, which makes it particularly suitable when:

- Your data naturally fits a document structure rather than tables
- Different records need different fields (polymorphism)
- You want to store related data together rather than spread across tables
- Your schema needs to evolve quickly
- You prioritize development speed over strict data consistency"

## What about Graph database ?

SQL database are called relational databases, the relation between object (tables) is explicitly defined by foreign keys.

Product ->  Vegetables -> Location Origin
Product ->  Vegetables -> Bio / not Bio
Product -> nutrition (sugar, fat etc)
Product -> nutriscore labels
Product -> ConsumeBy

![product veggies schema relation](/img/product-veggies-schema-relation.png)

What's interesting in that schema is that the LLM naturally added some meaning, some information to the relations between tables.

But in fact the same database schema in a SQL database would lack any information on the nature of the relation between the tables.

We would only have an indication of the cardinality of the relation:

- 1 to 1
- 1 to many

Graph database however are all about **relationships**.

The key differentiating concept of graph databases vs SQL databases is:

In graph databases (Neo4j), **relationships** are as important as the data itself and are stored explicitly.

These relationships:

- Have their own properties
- Are stored as connections

While in SQL:

- Relationships are implicit through foreign keys
- Must be reconstructed through JOINs
- Get exponentially more complex/slower as you follow multiple levels of connections

[TODO]: not great

Simple analogy

- SQL is like having a list of people and a separate list of who knows who
  - you need to keep checking both lists to find "friends of friends"
- Neo4j is like having everyone in a room with actual strings connecting friends
  - you just follow the strings to find "friends of friends"

That's why Neo4j excels at questions like:

- "Find all friends of friends who like jazz and live in Paris"
- "What's the shortest path between person A and person B?"
- "Who are the most influential people in this network?"

## conclusion

So SQL aka relational databases are great for data structure that does not change often and where relations between objects are stable.

No-SQL database like MongoDB : great when data specifications are evolving rapidly or are not set in stone, flexible schema

Graph database : relation is key. it's not only that there is a relation but also what is that relation about.


High view: NoSQL is about scaling and data evolution. Graph is about answering specific questions, fining ddiffermt type of meaning and hindsights in the data.
